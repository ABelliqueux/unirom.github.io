# UniROM Bootdisc, Firmware, Shell for PSX

Custom Xplorer, Action replay and cheat cart firmware, bootdisc, import player, region switcher, FreePSXBoot installer, Memcard manager, kernel resident debugger...

## At least read this bit:

You can install unirom to a cheat cart or memory card... or by burning a copy of the boot CD.

#### You burn + boot the bootdisc, then use the installers on it.

Installing to a *cheat cart* lets you boot into unirom in about a second, and dual boot Caetla.

Installing to a *memory card* + FreePSXBoot allows you to use models with no parallel port: PSOne, SCPH9000, etc.

1. Make sure you grab a good redump copy of the disc (not some crappy ECM'd rip from a random site)
2. Try another burner (some discs prefer some burners)
3. Burn it at low speed
4. Use good quality discs. "Verbatim" is generally good.
5. Try on another machine
6. Is the disc clean?
6. But like... did you *really* check?

> Still not booting!

Okay, at a minimum I need to know:

- How are you booting the machine (cheat cart, boot CD, freePSXBoot etc)
- What model is the machine?
- What game?
- What region is the game from?
- What burner did you use?
- Is the disc clean?
- What brand of disc did you use?
- Does your PC read the disc?
- Is the machine modded?
- Is the laser making any noises?

Don't forget the info above!
