# UniROM Bootdisc, Firmware, Shell for PSX

Custom Xplorer, Action replay and cheat cart firmware, bootdisc, import player, region switcher, FreePSXBoot installer, Memcard manager, kernel resident debugger...

## At least read this bit:

You can install unirom to a cheat cart or memory card... or boot it from the boot CD.

*The installers are on this disc*

Booting via cheat cart lets you boot into unirom in about a second, and dual boot Caetla.

Booting via memory card + FreePSXBoot allows you to use models with no parallel port: PSOne, SCPH 9000, etc.

1. make sure you grab a good redump copy of the disc (not some ECM'd shit from a random site)
2. try another burner (some discs prefer some burners)
3. burn it at low speed
4. user good quality discs. it makes a difference. Verbatim is preferred.
5. Try on another machine

If you're still having issues, let me know.
