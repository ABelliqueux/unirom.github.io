## Mod-free booting

Once unirom has booted (from memcard or via flash cart), it will unlock the drive via nocash unlock* meaning you can play imports and stuff without needing to swap discs.
Except on Japanese units. For those you can use a modchip, xStation, etc or just stop the disc as described below:

- boot with a black disc in
- go to the boot menu and hit "stop disc"
- swap discs
- don't look at the fucking laser
( it'll be deactivated, but incase it isn't for whatever reason, don't fucking look at it)
- put your other disc in and boot as normal.

> It's not working!

Someone's probably solved it: [Troubleshooting](/#troubleshooting)



note*: some nicolases don't like the term "nocash unlock"

## PAL/NTSC switch / region override

Allows you to force the video mode of a game to PAL or NTSC.

- PAL->NTSC will be the slightly higher PAL resolution with the slightly higher NTSC framerate.
- NTSC-PAL will be the slightly lower NTSC resolution with the slightly lower PAL framerate.

There's a clear winner there.

>Help! It's black and white!

Some hardware just can't handle the slightly off-spec video output from one machine doing the other's output.
You can use a better scaler, DFO mod, etc or just enjoy it like an old black n white movie.

Note: This feature is unlikely to work with homebrew that doesn't use the official PSYQ SDK.
