`How do I install unirom?`
Via Unirom!


Boot up the boot disc and it'll let you copy itsself to your cheat cart or memory card.

### Without Mod Chip

- Download the bootdisc from [The unirom release page](https://github.com/JonathanDotCel/unirom8_bootdisc_and_firmware_for_ps1/releases/)
- Burn to CD using ImgBurn.
- Use the best CDRs you can find. A name brand like Verbatim tends to work no problem.
- Use the lowest speed your writer supports.
- Don't stare at the fucking laser
- Boot using the swap trick
- Don't stare at the fucking laser
- Go to "Install" on the main page
- Seriously, don't look at the fucking laser though.
- Is my cheat cart supported? [Probably yes](#supported-cheat-carts)

### Using another cheat cart

There's a good chance your existing cheat cart can make the above swap easier:

- Jam down the lid sensor on your PSX 
- Put an original/black disc in
- Turn the machine on, and go to the file viewer, let it happen
- Back out of the menu
- The drive is now unlocked
- Don't look at the fucking laser
- Put the burned disc in the drive
- Don't look at the fucking laser
- Start the "game"
- Is my cheat cart supported? [Probably yes](#supported-cheat-carts)

### Modded PS2 or PS3

- Grab the FreePSXBoot+Unirom images from: [FreePSXBoot](bit.ly/freepsxboot))
- Write them to a memory card.
- Profit?

### With Mod Chip, xStation, etc

- Just burn the CD and boot it: [Download page](https://github.com/JonathanDotCel/unirom8_bootdisc_and_firmware_for_ps1/releases/)
- Is my cheat cart supported? [Probably yes](#supported-cheat-carts)

Almost all of them, even DIY franken carts.
It's only the jankiest of jank knockoffs that might not. And most jank knockoffs are fine.
