A: Via Unirom! Boot up the boot disc and it'll let you copy itsself to your cheat cart or memory card. Without Mod Chip Download the bootdisc from the unirom release page Burn to CD using ImgBurn.

Some carts cheaped out and used a ROM or a chip that was impossible to reprogram with the PS1's power supply. In those cases, replace it? Rom Flashing To install to a cheat cart, the installer will write over the existing ROM. You'll need the bootdisc in the drive for it to find the files. All cheat carts are at least 128k. This will fit unirom standalone. Some cheat carts have 256k or higher. These will allow you to dual boot unirom & caetla. The installer will attempt to auto-detect your cart type and size. If you've frankensteined a cart together, or have an unsupported chip, you can try to use the 'manual' setup option, and tell it roughly what to try. Every EEPROM I've encountered in the wild is currently supported. It won't flash! Try unirom_standalone Definitely start by updating to the latest version! Go to the status screen and see if it has any sort of valid ID or name for your card Try forcing manual mode, 128k/256k from the manual cart detector I wanna make a backup! You can back it up via nops if you care. Or you can restore most carts from the boot disc: Restoring ROMS Is my cheat cart supported? Probably yes Installing via FreePSXBoot FreePSXBoot is the exploit (like FreeMCBoot for PS2) which allows you to boot unirom from the memory card. Unirom will automatically detect your playstation bios version and install the appropriate card image of the same version. Many thanks to all of the FreePSXBoot contributers for their work on this!
